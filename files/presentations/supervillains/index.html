As director of Supervillain Academy, it is my duty to welcome you...
HEY!
You two at the back, put those matter annihilators DOWN!
Don&#39;t make me come up there!
As I was saying: you are all extremely fortunate to have ME welcoming you to another term at Supervillain Academy.
I know this is a particularly exciting term for many of you because this is the beginning of our highly anticipated Astronomy for Supervillains lecture series, the first lecture of which is given by ME.
But before we start, I&#39;d like to remind you of something very important.</p>
<p>In case of emergency, fire exits are located to either side and at the back of the room. </p>
<p>I&#39;d now like to remind you of something else very important.</p>
<p>We are great.
Each and every one of you earned your place here at Supervillain Academy because you are destined for greatness.
In fact, our students invariably go on to carry out some of the most dastardly acts of supervillainry you&#39;ve ever heard of.
I can name scores of them, some you&#39;ve heard of and some you probably haven&#39;t.
Doctor Octopus.
Mister Freeze.
Count Nefaria.
Harley Quinn.
Just some of the supervillains who have passed, like you, through this school.</p></aside>

You are thinking of hitting the earth with a rock of some kind.
It does have a certain brutal simplicity to it.
You will require three things for this.</p>

Another planet will do, or an asteroid in a pinch.

<li><strong>Rockets</strong>! Needless to say, this is where a second career as a Wall Street trader will help you out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, you will need <strong>very good mathematicians</strong> to plot your course with these rockets, because you want a HEAD-ON collision.

The only clue to its destruction would be a massive pulse of light spreading out through the universe.
The energy released would be the equivalent of the Sun&#39;s yearly energy release... 89 million times over.
Isn&#39;t this a tempting prospect!?
To wipe the Earth from the universe as if it had never existed?
The problem is that antimatter is very rare in our universe, and no-one really knows why.
It is therefore very difficult to find or manufacture.
If you had a much smaller amount of antimatter, you could instead create a matter-antimatter bomb and just destroy the Earth by blowing it to pieces, leaving it as just another asteroid belt.</p>
<p>But in the end, this technique ultimately fails the Supervillain Creed for being pedestrian.
A bomb? How crude.
A smart supervillain knows that there are other, more powerful forces in the universe.</p></aside>

You would need a pair of black holes in London.
Of course, the real danger here isn&#39;t gravitational waves any more.
It&#39;s spaghettification: the immense pull from being so close to a black hole would stretch the Earth out like a strand of spaghetti.
Therefore, in order to destroy the Earth, you could simply place it close to a black hole, or make one yourself.
They&#39;re quite small. Very portable, really.</p>
<p>This plan ticks all the supervillain check boxes.
It is impressive. Imagine the Earth disappearing into a black hole, or being torn apart by a pair of them!
It is ingenious: no-one will EVER suspect that you are trying to create a black hole right in London.
And it is completely impractical. In order to achieve this, you will need to collect enough matter from 60 suns and compress it into a space smaller than the M25.
THIS is truly a plan worthy of a supervillain&#39;s career!</p></aside>

<h2>The inverse square law</h2><p><img src="images/inverse-square-law.svg" width=720px></img></p><aside class="notes"><p>Students, take careful notes!
This is an excellent example of something that is a constant thorn in the side of many unsuspecting supervillains: the <em>inverse-square-law</em>.
In general, energy sources fall off with the square of the distance from the source.
For example, if we view a lightbulb from twice as far, the energy from it is spread over an area four times as large. 
This is true not only for light.
It is why the gravity of the Sun cannot rip us apart.</p>
<p>By the way, this is why so many of the best evil plans involve <em>lasers</em>.
By focusing energy into a beam, we can avoid losing it to all the directions where it&#39;s not needed!
But even a laser spreads out with distance and so your lasers will need to be VERY narrow if you are going to fire them a long way.
If you don&#39;t put enough energy in then you will be a laughing stock!</p></aside>

They are the brightest things in the universe, and their energy is highly focused into beams that span unimaginable distances.
This would seem to be the ideal force for a supervillain to harness!
But they fall down in two respects.</p>
<p>First, we have no control over them.
They originate from far outside our galaxy, at distances we can only dream of reaching within our lifetimes.
And here the inverse-square law strikes again: even these are the brightest things in the universe, they are weak and feeble by the time they reach us.
We have no way to cause a gamma-ray burst within the Milky Way where it might be able to do damage.
But more importantly, even the almighty power of a gamma ray burst would leave the Earth&#39;s physical form virtually untouched!
It would be deadly to life, but an ambitious supervillain with the primary goal of reducing our planet to rubble would be sadly disappointed.</p></aside>

How would you move the Sun?</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>We can&#39;t attach rockets to it.
But what if we put a hat on the sun?
Imagine making an enormous mirror that reflects half of the light from the sun.
Because light carries a tiny bit of energy and momentum with it, reflecting the light like this would cause the Sun to start moving on the direction of the mirror.
If we very carefully balance the radiation pressure on the mirror and the gravity from the Sun, the mirror will stay in the same place over the Sun while the Sun speeds up and up.</p>
<p>This is called a Shkadov Engine, after Dr. Leonid Mikhailovich Shkadov.
Dr. Shkadov, we salute you for your work: only a supervillain of the highest order could come up with such an idea!</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it is a veeeeery slow way to move anything.
Any guesses as to how fast our sun would be moving after, say a million years? ...It&#39;s about 40 miles per hour.
After one million years our sun wouldn&#39;t even be breaking the motorway speed limit!
And what&#39;s worse, the gravity of the Sun would just drag the Earth along with it anyway!

</div><aside class="notes"><p>Because whether it&#39;s a rogue star flying into Earth, or the Sun expanding into a red giant and swallowing Earth up, or the universe collapsing, or just all subatomic particles decaying into nothing, one thing&#39;s for sure: something will get Earth in the end, and maybe if you have a silver tongue then you can claim you were behind it all along.</p></aside>

<h2>Summary</h2><ul>
<li>Don&#39;t even <em>think</em> about destroying Earth without astrophysics.</li>
<li>Remember the <em>inverse-square law</em>.</li>
<li>Be <em>patient</em>.</li>
<li>Always, always have a <em>back-up plan</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="red fragment">…and remember that you will probably fail.</p><aside class="notes"><p>Students! I hope you have learned your lesson from today. The Universe is not to be trifled with. The Earth is old and enormous and you will not destroy it easily. Only with the rest of the universe on your side can you possibly have a chance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember the inverse-square law. It is your worst enemy.</li>
<li>If all else fails, be patient. This may be easier if you are immortal.</li>
<li>Finally, always have a back-up plan. You may want to start small. You could destroy another planet, or a moon, as a warm-up.</li>
</ul>
<p>But ultimately, know that you will probably fail.
And that&#39;s okay.
Remember that this is your role as supervillain: to concoct the wildest schemes you can imagine.
To dream big.
And tomorrow&#39;s lecture will continue this theme with more relevant topics: how to construct a moon base, how to control the world&#39;s media and how to recruit minions. It will be followed by a practical workshop on how to write a killer monologue.</p>
<p>Students! Thank you for your attention. I, SCOTT THOMAS, galactic tyrant, megalomaniac, egomaniac, pyromaniac and three-time cover model for Supervillain Monthly, wish you all the best for your future super-villainous careers.</p></aside>

<h3 class="red fragment">Thank you and have a <em>super</em> evening</h3><aside class="notes"><p>Ladies and gentlemen, if you&#39;ve enjoyed today&#39;s talk, you may want to check out the wonderful website <a href="http://qntm.org/destroy">How to Destroy the Earth</a> which served as the inspiration for much of this.</p>
<p>And of course, please let me reassure everyone in this room that, although some of these ideas are technically possible, none of this is about to happen to us any time soon.
That&#39;s unless one of you is secretly a supervillain and has come for inspiration, in which case we may all be doomed.</p>
<p>Finally, thank you for being a wonderful audience! Any questions?</p>
<p>[If need to stall for time, make sure to ask children for other ideas as to how they could destroy the planet.]</p></aside>
