<p><img src="images/about-the-author.jpg" alt=""></p><aside class="notes"><p>I&#39;m Scott, and I wanted to start by saying a little bit about being an astronomer.</p>
<p>Astronomy is a great field to study and work in.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most days I get to do interesting things, and the days when I don&#39;t are few and far between. Often these little bits of down-time are nice mental break.</li>
<li>I&#39;m always testing myself, whether it&#39;s trying to understand a tricky bit of physics or maths, writing code to investigate a pressing problem, or putting my findings together into talks, posters, or papers.</li>
<li>I work with some of the cleverest people on the planet.</li>
<li>I know that the things I work on are inspiring to many people, and I get to interact with the public, tell them about what I do, and see the wonder in their eyes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite all this, however, it&#39;s not a dream job.
I&#39;m a student, which means I don&#39;t get paid very much.
And there are a lot of astronomy students in the world and not many jobs, so competition for academic positions is fierce.
I&#39;ve dreamed of being an astronomer since I was about ten, but like any wise student, I make sure I have a plan B.</p></aside>

<ul>
<li>At first I considered lion taming. Yeah! Lion taming is glamorous and exciting. I&#39;d always have that thrill of danger about me. But it turns out that the training is long, expensive, and has a very poor survival rate...</li>
<li>Then I thought, why not just hit it big as a rock musician? With my long hair, I could easily have classic glam rock looks. But then reality hit: I play the clarinet, not the guitar. There&#39;s no way I am rock enough.</li>
<li>However, I&#39;ve hit on a sure win: picture books! Yes! Finally an area where mediocre art skills and limited vocabulary are not a handicap. I can make a splash in the world of children&#39;s literature.</li>

<p><img src="images/stop.jpg" alt=""></p><aside class="notes"><h3>Aside: protoplanetary disks</h3><p>Before we go on: what is a protoplanetary disk?
A young star, like the unnamed star we saw earlier, forms from the gravitational collapse of material in a molecular cloud - mostly hydrogen molecules.
As the collapse happens, conservation of angular momentum causes the material to spin faster, flattening the cloud out into a large disk.</p></aside>

<p><img src="images/e-imagining-future.jpg" alt=""></p><aside class="notes"><p>The gas that was to eventually become E sat and hummed excitedly.
It could not wait to become a planet - one of many in the beautiful dark of space.
And it looked out at all its friends in the Universe and wondered.
&quot;Will I be a big planet? Will I be a small planet? Will I be more than one planet? Will I have moons and rings? And what about all these other gas clouds in the universe? What kinds of planets will they be?&quot;
E couldn&#39;t wait to see what kinds of planets its friends in other protoplanetary disks would turn into.</p></aside>
</section>
<section id="stop-3" class="slide" data-has-notes="true">
<p><img src="images/stop.jpg" alt=""></p><aside class="notes"><h3>Aside: a single cloud of gas?</h3><p>I&#39;m ashamed to say that I&#39;ve told a bit of a visual lie.
For simplicity, I drew the character of &quot;pre-E&quot; as a big lump of gas.
I made it sound like this lump of gas lives within the protoplanetary disk and is going to turn into a planet.
But it&#39;s not quite as simple as that.
It&#39;s not correct to think of E as being a distinct cloud of gas at this stage, because the process by which planets form is thought to be much more piecemeal.
Let&#39;s return to our protoplanetary disk, where E is about to form an actual planet, and you can see what really happens.</p></aside>
</section>
<section id="e-grows" class="slide" data-has-notes="true">
<p><img src="images/e-grows.jpg" alt=""></p><aside class="notes"><p>Within the protoplanetary disk, things started to happen.
Slowly, slowly, the gravity of the protoplanetary disk did its work!
Gas condensed into dust, dust stuck together into bigger grains,
<em>mumble mumble</em>
and suddenly there were planetesimals - big chunks of rock, tens or hundreds of metres across!
As they collided and grew more massive, E was put together, piece by piece.</p></aside>
</section>
<section id="stop-4" class="slide" data-has-notes="true">
<p><img src="images/stop.jpg" alt=""></p><aside class="notes"><h3>Aside: the metre-size barrier</h3><p>I was very vague right there, wasn&#39;t I?
The truth is that this is one of the outstanding mysteries in planet formation known as the metre-size barrier.
The name refers to the fact that we don&#39;t really have any good theory for how these grains of dust and rock get to be much bigger than a metre.
The problem is that, at this size, we think it is difficult to get the right kinds of collisions, ones that will cause the objects to get bigger rather than fragmenting.
Obviously it can happen - because it does - but we don&#39;t yet have a single good explanation for how.</p>
<p>You can also now see why the idea of a single cloud of gas condensing into a solid ball isn&#39;t really right.
E is made of lots of different bits of dust and rock stuck together, and this dust can come from all over the protoplanetary disk.
Even after we get to the stage of having lots of rocks, they can be scattered all over the place by the gravitational influence of other forming planets.</p></aside>
</section>
<section id="young-e" class="slide" data-has-notes="true">
<p><img src="images/young-e.jpg" alt=""></p><aside class="notes"><p>Finally, E was a beautiful planet, cooling slowly.
E knew that there was something special about it.
E was:</p>
<ul>
<li>just the right distance from the sun to be</li>
<li>just the right temperature to have</li>
<li>just the right kind of surface with</li>
<li>just the right amount of water to have</li>
<li>just the right kind of environment and</li>
<li>just the right kind of atmosphere.</li>
</ul>
<p>Very soon... well, after millions of years... the surface of E crawled with life.</p>
<p>E stretched, yawning its tectonic plates, and cast its gaze around upon the Universe.
&quot;I can&#39;t wait to see what other beautiful planets there are, and what kinds of life they have on them!&quot;</p>
<p>But when E looked around the Universe it saw that in many other places things had gone very, very wrong.</p></aside>
</section>
<section id="jupiter-belt" class="slide" data-has-notes="true">
<p><img src="images/jupiter-belt.jpg" alt=""></p><aside class="notes"><p>E had undergone a series of mergers at the protoplanetary stage, when many smaller bodies had stuck together.
This resulted in E getting bigger and bigger as the debris around the star cleared.
But countless other planets were prevented from even forming in the first place because of the gravitational effects of other stars and planets in their solar system.
Even within E&#39;s own solar system, there was a huge gas giant with an angry red spot whose gravitational influence left a scattered belt of asteroids.
These poor bits of rock might never get together to make a planet.</p></aside>

<section id="rogue-encounters" class="slide" data-has-notes="true">
<p><img src="images/rogue-encounters.jpg" alt=""></p><aside class="notes"><p>Early in E&#39;s life, a collision with another protoplanet had split it, creating a moon.
Now this moon stabilised E, stopping it wobbling too much as it spun.
What&#39;s more, E had a stable and safe orbit.
But other planets were not so lucky.
Some of them passed too close to other planets and were thrown out of their solar system.
Some of them formed around binary or triple stars but could not hold on to their unstable orbits and were flung into space.
And some of them even had a rogue star pass through their solar system, scattering the planets far and wide.
Without a star to warm them, these planets would freeze in the depths of space.</p></aside>
</section>
<section id="stop-5" class="slide" data-has-notes="true">
<p><img src="images/stop.jpg" alt=""></p><aside class="notes"><h3>Aside: resonances and rogues</h3><p>There are a few root causes why a planet might get ejected from a solar system, but they all operate in one way: the planet swings too close to another object and gets a gravitational assist, destroying its regular orbit and sending it flying.
Rogue stars are also a real thing.
There are even stars called hypervelocity stars which careen wildly through the galaxy, and some of them are travelling fast enough that they&#39;ll eventually escape the galaxy altogether.
It&#39;s thought that these stars are formed from multiple-star systems that went wrong.</p></aside>

<p><img src="images/runaway-accretion.jpg" alt=""></p><aside class="notes"><p>E had formed relatively close to its host star and was not too big.
But other planets got too big too fast.
They started accreting gas from the protoplanetary disk.
These planets couldn&#39;t stop drinking in the gas until it was all gone!
They became gas giants with thick atmospheres and no surfaces to speak of.
They had no continents or liquid oceans.
Surely they could not support life.</p></aside>

<section id="orbital-distance" class="slide" data-has-notes="true">
<p><img src="images/orbital-distance.jpg" alt=""></p><aside class="notes"><p>E was just the right distance from its star.
On E&#39;s surface, water could be liquid, free to flow.
But other planets were too close to their star and the water boiled off, or too far from their star and the water froze solid.
Surely these planets had no oceans full of fish or plants that drank fresh water.</p></aside>

<section id="no-atmosphere" class="slide" data-has-notes="true">
<p><img src="images/no-atmosphere.jpg" alt=""></p><aside class="notes"><p>E had a thin protective atmosphere.

The atmosphere kept the planet warm and cosy.
Other planets without atmospheres could not control their temperature.
They would freeze during the night and bake during the day.
Surely life would not survive such extreme changes in temperature.</p></aside>

<section id="magnetic-field" class="slide" data-has-notes="true">
<p><img src="images/magnetic-field.jpg" alt=""></p><aside class="notes"><p>E&#39;s interior was liquid magma, and it generated a magnetic field that kept out the wind from the Sun.
Thanks to the field, E&#39;s atmosphere kept a protective layer of ozone that stopped nasty UV radiation from getting in.
But other planets did not have this, and were bathed in intense radiation.
Surely these planets were unsafe for life to survive and thrive on.</p></aside>

<section id="boring-neighbourhood" class="slide" data-has-notes="true">
<p><img src="images/boring-neighbourhood.jpg" alt=""></p><aside class="notes"><p>E lived around a boring, safe star in a boring, safe location.
There were no supernovae, no black holes, no gamma ray bursts blasting radiation across the galaxy to exterminate E&#39;s life.
Other planets were not so lucky.
Some were fried by radiation and some were swallowed up by giant dying stars.</p>
<p>E looked around at the chaotic Universe and saw the dismal state of things.
From such promising childhoods, look at everything that went wrong!
Planets that never formed, planets that died, planets that never amounted to anything.</p>
<p>And in the middle of all this was E.
E had survived impacts and radiation.
E had watery oceans, continents, and air to breathe.
Through all this danger and uncertainty, E had made it.
E, also known as Earth, was... The Little Planet That Could.</p></aside>

Though E&#39;s ecosystem was amazing, it was also fragile.
When a meteorite hit E during its formation, it had caused a mass extinction and wiped out the dinosaurs - and it wasn&#39;t even a really big meteorite!
Surely E was unique.
Surely E was the only one to make it through and emerge covered with life.</p></aside>

<p><img src="images/stop.jpg" alt=""></p><aside class="notes"><h3>Aside: the anthropic principle</h3><p>Before we wrap up this story, it&#39;s time to talk about what it means to be special.
I&#39;ve continually referred to E as &quot;special&quot; and implied that it&#39;s somehow privileged in some way throughout this story.
But just because something is rare doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s special.</p></aside>

<section id="newspaper" class="slide" data-has-notes="true">
<p><img src="images/newspaper.jpg" alt=""></p><aside class="notes"><p>For example, can you imagine the uproar and the investigations that would occur if the lottery numbers came out as all ones?
But it&#39;s just as likely as any other possible combination.
Humans are very good at deciding that things are special based on trivial stuff like this.
Of course, there is nothing wrong with us ascribing the label &quot;special&quot; to something - we just need to be clear about what makes it special.
In the case of Earth, we call it special because it supports life.
It supports us.
And, as far as we know, it is the only planet to do so.
So in a sense, the only reason we can call the Earth special is because we believe ourselves to be special.
It&#39;s a little bit arrogant, sure, but it&#39;s certainly not wrong.
We must keep in mind, though, that ascribing this specialness to Earth is complicated by several kinds of bias.</p></aside>
</section>
<section id="anthropic-principle" class="slide" data-has-notes="true">
<p><img src="images/anthropic-principle.jpg" alt=""></p><aside class="notes"><p>The first kind of bias arises because we live, by definition, on a planet in an area of the universe that is &quot;habitable&quot;.
It sometimes goes under the name of the weak anthropic principle.
You may have heard of the astronomer Copernicus, who is best remembered for the idea that the Earth wasn&#39;t at the centre of the universe.
The weak anthropic principle is kind of the opposite idea.
It says that our location in the Universe must necessarily be privileged in some way.
Applied to the idea of planetary habitability, the weak anthropic principle goes something like this: if the Earth were not suitable for life, we wouldn&#39;t be here to observe it.
The evolutionary biologist Alfred Russell Wallace wrote: &quot;Such a vast and complex universe as that which we know exists around us, may have been absolutely required ... in order to produce a world that should be precisely adapted in every detail for the orderly development of life culminating in man.&quot;</p>
<p>The problem is that the weak anthropic principle doesn&#39;t explain much.
It&#39;s basically a tautology.
It&#39;s not an explanation for how something happens, just a convenient excuse for why it is like that now.
And it says nothing about the range of conditions that might be considered habitable, just that we happen to life somewhere that can support us.
That quote from Wallace also has a bit of an outdated view of evolution in it: it presupposes that life was part of some orderly development towards mankind, when really it might have swung off in another direction just as easily had circumstances been different.
Finally, there&#39;s also nothing to indicate that the world is perfectly adapted for us in any way.</p></aside>

<p><img src="images/inhospitable.jpg" alt=""></p><aside class="notes"><p>I mean, Earth is great, but have you seen how inhospitable some bits of it are?! (Sorry E)
Really, it&#39;s the other way around - the world is just as it is, and we are the ones who have adapted to IT.
Saying that the world is perfectly adapted for us is like saying that sausages are made long and narrow so they fit into hotdog buns.</p></aside>
</section>
<section id="selection-effect" class="slide" data-has-notes="true">
<p><img src="images/selection-effect.jpg" alt=""></p><aside class="notes"><p>A second kind of bias is observational bias.
When astronomers look for planets, we are able to see the large ones more easily.
This is because they have a stronger gravitational effect on their star; they block out more light when they pass in front of their star; and they can be seen directly if they are big enough.
This bias can lead us to think that Earth-sized planets are rarer than they actually are.
But we know our limitations, and we know that, at first, we often miss things that are actually there.
So we are confident that those Earths are out there.</p></aside>

<p><img src="images/the-little-planet-that-could.jpg" alt=""></p><aside class="notes"><p>E smiled and looked around.
E had realised something very important.
Although E is rare in one way, it doesn&#39;t mean that all planets need to be rare in exactly the same way to be special.
You&#39;ve heard the news about a few Earth-size planets being discovered around other stars.
Well, as they say, you ain&#39;t seen nothing yet.
We are just reaching a time when these discoveries are becoming easier and easier.
Soon E will have many, many friends.
And the key question is: are you feeling lucky?
The answer to this question is: it doesn&#39;t matter.
Because the galaxy and the universe is so big that there are almost certainly other E&#39;s, other planets out there that are special.
And even if they are quite different to E... this doesn&#39;t mean that there can&#39;t be life on them.</p></aside>
