      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Scott.
After a thrilling couple of decades in New Zealand where I learned to walk, talk, and pass myself off as a scientist, I headed overseas to continue my studies in astrophysics. Having spent some time working in Australia and Switzerland, I studied for a PhD at the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge. I now work as a data scientist at an educational technology company.
Past work During my PhD I worked with Nikku Madhusudhan on the structure and evolution of terrestrial (Earth-like) planets in other solar systems.</description>
