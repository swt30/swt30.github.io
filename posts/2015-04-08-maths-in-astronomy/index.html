<p>I gave a talk for the STEP Easter School, a summer programme for students from non-selective state schools who have been given offers to read mathematics at Cambridge. Although I never had the experience of applying to Cambridge as an undergrad, I can imagine that it would have been slightly terrifying! It was nice to get to talk to students who were in a similar position as I was, where their schools don&rsquo;t necessarily have a lot of funding to throw at helping them through examinations.</p>

<p>Anyway, I decided that the best thing to do would be to give a talk on the mathematics of astronomy, starting from some A-level principles and quickly moving on to explain how these were relevant to modern astrophysics. I covered three main themes:</p>

<ul>
<li>how some simple geometrical principles like arc lengths relate to the geometry of space time, and from there to idea of causality and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTwCdJftYD0">horizon problem</a> in cosmology;</li>
<li>how astrophysicists use differential equations to model things like the interiors of stars and planets; and</li>
<li>how N-body simulations allow us to take a simple set of behaviours (like the movement of particles under gravity) and, with the help of supercomputers, study the behaviour of large, chaotic systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the nicest things that happened after the talk was that a teacher came up to me and told me I was a natural and that the talk was excellent :)</p>

<p>Also, I gave it a silly title.</p>

<p>Since it contains a couple of large videos, including an animation of the Illustris simulation, I haven&rsquo;t put it online, but please <a href="/pages/contact">contact me</a> if you would like more information. I wrote the talk using the slideshow feature of <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Ipython notebook/Jupyter</a>, which uses <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/">Reveal.js</a>.</p>
